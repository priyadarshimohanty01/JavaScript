// Constant And Variables

/* 

Constant is only one type that "const" Keyword. It is used only if we don't want to change.

Variables are 2 types let and var but we should completely avoid var. 
var keyword is used in old generation but not in new generation because var keyword does noy support block scope and 
functional scope which means it can re-declare or re-assign. 

Block Scope means this "{}". Curly brackets is known as block scope.
